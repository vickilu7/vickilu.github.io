		Mycometrics is a microbiology services laboratory specialized in the identification of fungi (molds),
		bacteria and viruses from the environment, food, pharmaceutical or biological products. They were
		established to provide unique services, combining the use of both conventional and emerging technologies,
		and employing the highest standards available. <br/><br/>They're currently building a new version of their
		website and wanted an updated logo that matched the overall feel. My design incorporates traditional
		lab elements with the petri dish and microbe, but still preserves a minimalistic and clean look like
		the website. Below are before-and-after shots of their website with their respective logos.

		 A team of 4 students at Duke created <a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/mpower-hult" target="_blank">mPower</a>, a startup aiming to fill India’s shortage of agricultural
		 cold storage solutions by offering a novel product and distribution network that compensates farmers
		 and simplifies the supply chain. mPower won the Hult Prize @ Duke as well as one of 14 regional rounds
		 across the world in Mexico City.  They are now headed to the Hult finals held in London. The <a href="http://www.hultprize.org/" target="_blank">Hult Prize</a>,
		 the world’s largest social entrepreneurship competition for college students, advertises itself as the
		 “Nobel Prize for social entrepreneurs.” <br/><br/>
		 I was asked to show the energy-saving and environemental aspect of the startup in their logo and,
		 ideally, combine fruit/crops/plants visually. I created different versions of logo possibilities showing this.

     <a href="http://codeable.me/" target="_blank">Codeable Camps</a> strives to teach the younger generation the basic concepts behind programming in a way
     that is not only educational but also extremely engaging and interesting. Through the use of Scratch,
     an open source programming language produced by MIT, children of all ages are able to receive an early
     exposure to programming while developing games, animations, and many other applications in an intuitive
    and fun environment. The Codeable Camps logo features colorful blocks that are supposed to represent
    the action blocks used in Scratch programming.

     How can we make people mindful of the things they put out into the universe in an engaging way?
     We want to make being environmental more personal. People these days want to see their own individual
     impact, and <a href="https://devpost.com/software/entropy-sn8a3p" target="_blank">Entropy</a> is a way to do just that. With this personal dashboard, people are reminded of
     their daily habits and are brought face-to-face with their impact. I used a lot of nature elements for
     this project at Blueprint: Duke's sustainability conference. Below are some graphics used for the social aspect of Entropy–
     seeing your friends' plants to keep each other environmentally accountable.
