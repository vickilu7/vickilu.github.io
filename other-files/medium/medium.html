    Let me first start by saying that <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a> is one of my absolute three favorite services created
		(the other two being Spotify and Typeform). With its minimalistic and sophisticated UI as well
		as intuitive UX, the Medium app is nearly perfect in my eyes. However, as a user, I’ve found myself
		wishing it did have a more extensive bookmarking system.
	</p>
  <p class="project_subheader">Description of Project</p>
  <p class="project_paragraph">
    <strong>Problem</strong>: As of now, you can only either save articles you liked to your “Bookmarks” or to your “Claps”– offering only two lists to differentiate your articles.
		<br/>
		<strong>Solution</strong>: Create a feature that allows users to categorize their favorite articles into different categories. Think Pinterest boards or Youtube playlists! In the case of Medium, I decided to categorize the bookmarks into “shelves”.
  </p>

	<p class="project_subheader">Process and Work</p>
	<p class="project_paragraph">
		<strong>Inspiration</strong><br/>
		These “shelves” act as the topics in which users can sort their articles, much like how you’d place similar
		genre books near each other on a bookshelf. The way the bookmarking looks on the home page is heavily
		inspired by Airbnb. I felt that the clean and straightforward look of the Save to List modal window fit
		in quite well with Medium’s overall brand.</p>

		<strong>Low fidelity mockups</strong><br/>

		<strong>High fidelity mockups with Adobe XD</strong><br/>
		I recreated the Medium homepage to be more conscious of how my new feature would fit with the existing look and feel. The following pictures show the three groups of pages I made changes to for the new bookmarking function.

					<p class="project_paragraph">
						The diagram to the left shows the prototype flow, which I used a lot to ensure that all the
						functions of the new bookmarking feature would seem natural and intuitive to the user.
						<br/><br/>Something I did forget to add, but would be great to have, is an option to share your shelf.
						Medium is an inherently social platform that allows anyone to write and share ideas, so I think
						it’s always a good idea to keeping thinking about the ways we can connect people with people.
